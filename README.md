# markdown-parser

This is a markdown parser written in C++. This 
README also acts as the test file for the parser.

## Basic Tests

A markdown parser should be able to:

Differentiate **bold** and *italic* texts, using 
different markers _this_ and __this__.

See `inline code`.

See lists:

* an item
* another item
* surprise! its an item

With different markers:

- woah! a list
- a list?! with items!?
- item.

See ordered lists:

1. i am last
2. surprisingly, i am second
3. i am first. or am i?
